Conclusion
The best overall results were obtained with learning rates of 0.01 or 0.1 and batch sizes of 16 or 32.
A learning rate of 0.1 and batch size of 16 achieved the fastest convergence with the highest accuracy and F1 score.
Smaller batch sizes with higher learning rates produced the best balance of speed and performance across metrics, while larger batch sizes and lower learning rates slowed convergence and reduced accuracy
