This repository contains a simple implementation of a two-layer perceptron designed for binary classification tasks, demonstrated on the XOR problem.

Features
Two-layer perceptron with an input layer, hidden layer, and output layer.
ReLU activation for the hidden layer and sigmoid activation for the output layer.
Forward and backward propagation.
Mini-batch Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) optimizer.
Cross-entropy loss function.
Cross-validation for performance estimation.
Performance metrics including precision, recall, and F1-score.

Requirements
Python 3.x
NumPy
scikit-learn
matplotlib
pickle
Dataset
The dataset used is a toy XOR dataset stored in xordata.pkl
